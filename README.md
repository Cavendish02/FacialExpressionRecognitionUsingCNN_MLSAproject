# Facial Expression Recognition Using CNN  

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify human facial expressions into different categories, such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, and neutral. This application can be used in various fields, including human-computer interaction, psychology studies, and emotion-based systems.

## Features  

- **Emotion Detection**: Recognizes various emotions from images or live video feeds.  
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Uses a webcam or other camera for real-time emotion detection.  
- **Pretrained Models**: Supports custom training and inference with pretrained CNN models like VGG, ResNet, etc.  
- **Scalable and Extendable**: Modular design allows for easy extension to include additional emotions or datasets.

## Requirements  

The project requires the following dependencies:  

- Python (>=3.8)  
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  

Install the requirements using the following command:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Facial-Expression-Recognition.git  
   cd Facial-Expression-Recognition  
   ```  

2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Download or prepare the dataset (e.g., FER-2013, CK+).  

4. Train the model or use the pretrained model provided in the repository.

## Usage  

### Training the Model  

To train the model on your dataset:  
```bash  
python train.py --dataset <path_to_dataset> --epochs <num_epochs>  
```  

### Testing the Model  

To test the model on a single image:  
```bash  
python predict.py --image <path_to_image>  
```  

### Real-Time Emotion Detection  

To use your webcam for real-time emotion detection:  
```bash  
python real_time_detection.py  
```  

---

## Dataset  

The model can use datasets like **FER-2013** or **CK+** for training.  
- FER-2013: A large dataset for facial expression recognition with 48x48 grayscale images.  
- CK+: A smaller but highly accurate dataset for emotion detection.  

Ensure the dataset is structured properly before training.

## Model Architecture  

The CNN model consists of:  
1. **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction.  
2. **Pooling Layers**: To reduce dimensionality.  
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification.  
4. **Softmax Layer**: Outputs probabilities for each emotion category.  

---

## Results  

- **Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of ~85% on the test set.  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Evaluated to analyze model performance across different categories.  

---

## Future Work  

- Incorporate additional datasets to improve robustness.  
- Implement transfer learning for better accuracy.  
- Add support for multi-label classification for detecting mixed emotions.  
- Develop a user-friendly GUI for broader accessibility.
