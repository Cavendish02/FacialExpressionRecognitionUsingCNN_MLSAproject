This project implements a deep learning model for recognizing facial expressions from grayscale images. Using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras, the model is trained to classify facial expressions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.

The dataset includes preprocessed images of size 48x48 pixels, which are either loaded from a CSV file or organized into directories for training and validation. Additionally, the project provides functionality to visualize sample images and their corresponding labels.
